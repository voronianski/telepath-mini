### [Download](http://labs.voronianski.com/get-telepath-mini)

## Usage and Features

##### Connect your [Spotify](http://spotify.com) account

First _Telepath_ version works only with Spotify premium accounts.

##### Create music stream by unique tags 

For example you are able to use tags that will describe specific era or time (e.g. `summer 1995`, `80s`), specific genre (`brit pop`, `new wave`), similar artists or even mix them (`1990, indie rock`).

#### Add songs to your Spotify playlists

Just select one of your already created playlists to drop track to Spotify.

## Road Map

The main goal for the second version is to make _Telepath_ more suitable in terms of common desktop music player. I don't know yet whether the second version will be released as separate app or not but the main points are:

- [ ] make Spotify accounts optional
- [ ] add support for iTunes library
- [ ] add integration with Soundcloud
