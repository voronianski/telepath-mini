## Usage

#### Connect your [Spotify](http://spotify.com) account

First _Telepath Mini_ version works only with Spotify Premium accounts.

#### Create music stream using tags 

The main idea behind _Telepath Mini_ is to generate a music stream based on the list of tags specified by listener.

You are able to use _tags_ that will describe: 

- era or time (which is my personal favorite, for example tags like `summer 1995` or `1988-1990` will bring you the stream with popular tracks of that time)
- mood (`sentimental`)
- genres (`brit pop, new wave`)
- artists (`arctic monkeys`) 
- or even mix them together (`1990, sentimental, indie rock`)

#### Add songs to your [Spotify](http://spotify.com) playlists

Just select one of your already created playlists to drop playing track into Spotify.

## Technologies

## Road Map

The main goal for the second version is to make _Telepath Mini_ more suitable in terms of common desktop music player. 

I don't know yet whether the second version will be released as separate app but the main points to cover are:

- make Spotify accounts optional
- add support for iTunes library
- add integration with [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com)
